## benefits

If this is fully implemented with its own peer to peer network this can be thought of as a low cost timestamping layer for Bitcoin.

Previously you either had to timestamp your data yourself (not scalable if everybody does this) or rely on a free service. Only a handful of these services exist which can lead to censorship problems. Because it is possible to buy timestamps risk free over the lightning network[1] with this new scheme it will hopefully create a new market for timestamps and incentivize more people to run paid services. This could lead to a reduction of cost for users in need of timestamps and on-chain space savings for the whole Bitcoin community.



[1] the lightning network must switch from HTLCs to payment points and scalars
